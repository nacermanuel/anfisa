<br><br>
This is a #NEXTJS application developed using #TYPESCRIPT.
<br>
As a catalog of multiple brands and products, we decided to use #NEXTJS so we can build a mix of SSR and CSR components, allowing for optimized search engine indexing. 
<br>
We used the #TAILWINDCSS framework and the daisyUI components library to create a great UI. 
<br>
The backend was built with #NODEJS using #TYPESCRIPT and the #EXPRESS framework. 
<br>
A CRUD API was implemented to manage products, brands, and categories. We utilized #MONGOOSE as the ORM and #MONGODB Atlas as the cloud database. 
<br>
To handle responsibilities in a decoupled manner and facilitate easy modifications, we adopted a clean architecture. 
<br>
For frontend deployment, we are using #VERCEL. 
<br>
For backend deployment, we have opted for #RAILWAY.
